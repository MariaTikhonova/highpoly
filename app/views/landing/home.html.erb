<h2>You can use 3ds Max Design to visualize designs of real things that will actually be built, such as buildings and machines. The File Link feature of 3ds Max Design lets you base visualizations on designs created in AutoCAD ® or Autodesk Revit ® Architecture: When the design changes in these other applications, the revisions can be automatically updated in your 3ds Max Design scene. Add lighting and materials, then render to still image or movie formats.

These tutorials teach 3ds Max Design through a series of hands-on exercises. Prepare to be entertained and fascinated by the awesome power at your fingertips. </h2>
